# Deep-Q-Learning-LunarLander
Deep Q-Learning implementation for solving the Lunar Lander environment using PyTorch and OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to land a spacecraft safely by interacting with the environment, receiving rewards and penalties. Includes code for training, visualization, and a pre-trained model for demonstration.
